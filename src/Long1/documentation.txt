1. To read text from a file, I used a Scanner object. I read all lines from
the file into an ArrayList object, then I used the Random class's nextInt()
function (passing the ArrayList's size as an upper bound) to select a random
index from the list.

2. To create the encryption key, I created an ArrayList containing each letter
of the alphabet, then created a clone of it with ArrayList.clone(), shuffling
the clone with Collections.shuffle(). I then compared the two arrays and
created a HashMap<Character, Character>, with the inorder alphabet acting as
the keys, and the shuffled alphabet as the values. This HashMap acts as the
conversion key, mapping correct letters to encrypted ones.

3. To keep track of the user's guesses, I simply kept a String in my
CryptogramModel class to remember them: It starts out as a mostly empty String
copy of the input text (of the same size), with spaces where all letters
should be. I then insert guesses into the String directly as play continues.
Keeping the guess remembered means the String does not need to be
re-generated each guess.

4. Since my program keeps track of the full current user guess, I have my
program remember the correct input String, and compare the two after every
guess. If they are equal, the user has successfully completed the puzzle.
